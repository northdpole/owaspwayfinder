OWASP Wayfinder Automation
===

This wip repo contains a script to automate the creation of the [OWASP Wayfinder](https://owasp.org/projects/) graph.
Source material is in `projects.yaml` and contains all OWASP flagship projects.
The goal of this project is to automate the visualisation of how OWASP projects fit together from metadata.

Pull Requests are very welcome.
